## Description
In this assignment I put everything I have learned about HTML and CSS so far to create a website for "Square Eyes", a fictional movie streaming service.  

## Assignment Brief
A video streaming website where you can purchase high-quality videos directly from the people who make them. The users of this website want to purchase videos right away, which will allow them to watch it online.

The website should emphasise that you can easily discover great collections or browse through different categories to find films.
